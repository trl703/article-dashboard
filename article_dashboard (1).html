                    This article introduces the concept of building intelligent agents using <strong>LangGraph</strong>, a framework built on LangChain for creating structured workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs). The author walks through the process of designing an agent that plays <em>Rock Paper Scissors</em> against two human players, using strategy and historical data to make decisions.<br><br>
                    Key concepts covered:<br>
                    - <strong>Agent Flow</strong>: A structured, step-by-step approach to guide LLMs through tasks.<br>
                    - <strong>LangGraph Components</strong>: Nodes, edges, conditional edges, and state management.<br>
                    - <strong>Game Example</strong>: The agent receives player inputs, analyzes patterns, and determines winners.<br>
                    - <strong>Code Walkthrough</strong>: Includes Python code for state management, player input handling, and graph construction.<br>
                    - <strong>Outcome</strong>: Demonstrates how LangGraph enables flexible, context-aware agents.

                <td>
                    This article explores space-filling curves (SFCs), focusing on their mathematical origins and practical applications.
                    It introduces the Peano and Hilbert curves, explaining how they traverse every point in a space and possess fractal properties.
                    The Hilbert curve is examined in depth, including its formal definition and properties like continuity and locality preservation.
                    Skillingâ€™s algorithm is presented as a method for computing Hilbert curve coordinates using binary and Gray code transformations.
                    Applications include data partitioning, indexing, and clustering in platforms like Databricks, where Hilbert curves outperform Z-curves in preserving locality.
                    The article concludes with a look at adaptive indexing methods like AdaCurve for future data systems.
